<h3>Term insurance</h3>

Term plans are the most basic form of life insurance. They provide life cover
with no savings / profits component. They are the most affordable form of 
life insurance as premiums are cheaper compared to other life insurance plans.
Online term insurance plans provide pure risk cover, which explains the lower
premiums. A fixed sum of money - the sum assured – is paid to the beneficiaries
if the policyholder expires over the policy term. If the policyholder survives, 
there is no pay out.

<h3>Endowment plans</h3>

Endowment plans differ from term plans in one critical aspect 
i.e. maturity benefit. Unlike term plans which pay out the sum assured, 
along with profits, only in case of an eventuality over the policy term,
endowment planspay out the sum assured under both scenarios – death and 
survival. However, endowment plans charge higher fees / expenses – reflected 
in premiums – for paying out sum assured, along with profits, in either 
scenario – death or maturity. The profits are an outcome of premiums being
invested in asset markets – equities and debt.

<h3>Unit linked insurance plans (ULIP)</h3>

ULIPs are a variant of the traditional endowment plan.They pay out the sum 
assured (or the investment portfolio if its higher) on death/maturity.
ULIPs differ from traditional endowment plans in certain areas. As the 
name suggests, performance of ULIP is linked to markets. Individuals can 
choose the allocation for investments in stock/debt markets. The value of
the investment portfolio is captured by the NAV (net asset value). To that
end, there are many similarities between ULIPs and mutual funds. ULIPs differ
in one area, they are a combination of investment and insurance, while mutual 
funds are a pure investment avenue

<h3>Whole life policy</h3>

A whole life insurance policy covers a policyholder over his life. The main feature
of a whole life policy is that the validity of the policy is not defined so the 
individual enjoys the life cover throughout his life. The policyholder pays regular 
premiums until his death, upon which the corpus is paid out to the family. The policy 
expiresonly in case of an eventuality as there is no pre-defined policy tenure.
Money back policy

A money back policy is a variant of the endowment plan. It gives periodic payments
 over the policy term. To that end, a portion of the sum assured is paid out at regular 
 intervals. If the policy holder survives the term, he gets the balance sum assured.
  In case of death over the policy term, the beneficiary gets the full sum assured.
